\chapter{GL-117 Basics}
\label{chap:basics}

Having understood the physical aspects of piloting,
you may now get an introduction to the game itself.


\section{Cockpit controls}
\label{sec:cockpit}

\label{fig:hud}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hud} shows a typical \textit{HUD} (head-up display):
\begin{itemize}
\item{A: your current heading, showing the letters \texttt{'N', 'E', 'S', W'}
to represent north, east, south, west.}
\item{B: your current elevation in degree; the rotating lines reveal the
horizon and thus your roll angle.}
\item{C: your current target}
\item{D: the radar reveals the position of other targets. Enemies are marked red,
allies blue, missiles white. The screen is only 2D, so it will only reveal the necessary \textit{heading} to
other targets.}
\item{F: your currently selected weapon}
\item{G: the chaff/flare countermeasure systems alarms you about enemy missiles.}
\end{itemize}



\section{Input devices}
\label{sec:input_devices}

\emph{GL-117} supports a number of devices depending on \texttt{GLUT} and \texttt{SDL}.
You may choose your preferred input device within the options menu.
It is strongly recommended to use a joystick, however the mouse interface
is also very easy to handle.

\subsection{The keyboard}
\label{subsec:keyboard}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textsc{Key} & \textsc{Meaning}\\\hline
UP, DOWN & Elevator\\
LEFT, RIGHT & Roll\\
SHIFT-LEFT/RIGHT & Rudder\\
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 & Throttle\\
S, X & Inc/Dec Thrust\\
\hline
SPACE & Fire cannon\\
m & Change weapon/missile\\
ENTER & Fire weapon/missile\\
\hline
t & Target next object\\
p & Target previous object\\
e & Target nearest enemy\\
p & Target locking enemy\\
\hline
ESC & Main menu\\
\hline
F1 & Cockpit camera\\
F2 & Chase camera\\
F3 & Rear camera\\
F4, F5 & Side cameras\\
F6, F7, F8 & Top cameras\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This tabular only shows the predefined settings. You may customize the
keyboard in the options menu.

Also note that using the mouse is much easier! It only needs some practise.


\subsection{The mouse}
\label{subsec:mouse}

Moving the mouse up or down will change the elevator to fly a loop, whereas
moving left or right will result in a roll, a slight movement will
affect the rudder.\\
To change your heading, you will thus have to move the mouse cursor completely
to the left/right for a short moment (just figure it out) in order to fly a
quarter roll. Return the mouse cursor to the center immediately!
Then alter the elevator moving the mouse to the top center of your screen to
fly a "loop" parallel to the surface.\\
The left mouse button can be used to fire the cannon, the right button will
fire the weapon/missile, although it is recommended to use the keyboard for
targeting and firing purpose.\\
Look at the keyboard table for a list of keys.\\
You may also revert the mouse or even change to relative mouse movements (not recommended).


\subsection{The joystick}
\label{subsec:joystick}

The easiest interface to play \emph{GL-117} is most likely the joystick.\\
\emph{GL-117} supports up to 10 joysticks each having up to 10 axes,
however the standard settings include one joystick with 4 axes:
moving the joystick up or down will change the elevator, moving left or right
will affect the aileron, turning the joystick along the rudder will alter
the fighter's rudder settings, and moving the throttle will change
the fighter's throttle.\\\\
Depending on your joystick, \emph{GL-117} supports four buttons:
fire cannon, target nearest enemy, fire countermeasure, fire weapon/missile.
The coolie hat is used for targeting purpose.\\\\
Feel free to edit the text file \texttt{conf.interface} to completely
adjust all the settings as you wish.


\section{The menu}
\label{sec:menu}

As the menu is almost completely self-explanatory, there is only a brief
description of the different menu items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The \texttt{PILOTS} menu lets you create and delete pilots. You can
play only one pilot at a time.}
\item{The \texttt{TRAINING} menu contains a bunch of training mission and tutorials you should start with.}
\item{The \texttt{CAMPAING} menu shows the available missions. You have to
succeed in a mission to enable the next one.
Every mission you succeed will earn you a certain score, being calculated
depending on the time it took, the shield you lost, how many targets you
eliminated, and a difficulty bonus.
High scores are necessary to get a promotion to a higher military rank.
The difficulty bonus is added to the overall score automatically.}
\item{Several \texttt{OPTIONS} may be adjusted: quality, view, sound, music,
difficulty.}
\end{itemize}

To get the best graphics possible on your system, always look at the
\texttt{FPS} rate which describes the number of frames per second.
This rate is directly influenced by the quality and view settings and
should not drop below 25. If your rate is above 50 FPS, you should
use higher/better quality and view settings.
You should also try out higher screen resolutions modifying the file
\texttt{conf} located in the \texttt{saves}
directory on MSWindows, in the directory \texttt{\$HOME/.gl-117} for UNIX respectively.
