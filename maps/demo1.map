# This is an example mission text file.
# Important rules:
# - There are several blocks like "INFO" consisting of special attributes
# - Assigments have the form "attribute = value" and are put in one line
# - All attributes are optional if not described as "required"
# - Everything is case-insensitive (iNfO=info=INFO)
# - Quotes have to be used if a value consists of whitespace (tabs, spaces)
# - Comments start with a '#' and end with a line feed (end of line)
# - Syntax errors are currently displayed on stderr when initing the mission
