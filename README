GL-117 is an action flight simulator written in C++ and OpenGL.
It is distributed unter the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

- Linux, MSWindows, MacOS
- GL, GLU (or Mesa equivalents), GLUT
- SDL, SDL_mixer (both optional but strongly recommended)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MSWINDOWS INSTALLATION:

You might have to install GL, GLU, GLUT, and SDL, SDL_mixer
Look into your system directory, that is
 \WINDOWS\SYSTEM for Win9x/ME
 \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 for WinNT/2000/XP.
You need the files opengl32.dll, glu32.dll, glut32.dll, and sdl.dll,
sdl_mixer.dll stored there! If one is missing, search the internet.
Now unpack the Windows version of the game and doubleclick gl-117.exe.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
UNIX/LINUX PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

If you got a package for your system there is no more to do than
installing it. Use "gl-117" to execute the game.
However, you will need the packages
	GL, GLU, GLUT, and SDL, SDL_mixer
properly installed on your system.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
UNIX/LINUX COMPILE THE SOURCES:

If you have to compile the sources, you will need the packages (as above)
	GL, GLU, GLUT, and SDL, SDL_mixer
and the -devel equivalents
	GL-devel, GLU-devel, GLUT-devel, SDL-devel, SDL_mixer
OR:	mesa-devel, mesaglu-devel, mesaglut-devel, SDL-devel, SDL_mixer
as well.

1. To compile gl-117, as root just execute
	./configure
or as non-root, please use
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/gl-117
to install gl-117 to your local folder without root permissions.

2. Then execute
	make
to compile the sources.
The new binary is in the src directory and may there be executed using
	./gl-117

3. Finally, you can enter
	make install
to properly install all game files.
Then start the game just executing
	gl-117
NEVER execute gl-117 as root!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
STARTUP CONFIGURATION:

When starting the game, it will test for a valid screen resolution
and save the startup settings in a file called "conf".
All interface options are stored to "conf.interface".

Where are these files?
MSWindows: PATH/TO/GL-117/saves
Unix/Linux: $HOME/.gl-117

The configuration options are quite self-explanatory, feel free to
adjust them to your system.

If you lack a hardware accelerated video card, please set the
quality option to 0 or 1. Further acceleration can be achieved
negligating fullscreen mode and making the window smaller.

Please look at the file FAQ for further questions.
